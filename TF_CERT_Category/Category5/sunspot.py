# There are 5 questions in this exam with increasing difficulty from 1-5.
# Please note that the weight of the grade for the question is relative

# Don't use lambda layers in your model.
# You do not need them to solve the question.
# Lambda layers are not supported by the grading infrastructure.

# You must use the Submit and Test button to submit your model

# QUESTION
#
# Build and train a neural network to predict sunspot activity using
# the Sunspots.csv dataset.
#
# Your neural network must have an MAE of 0.12 or less on the normalized dataset
# for top marks.
#
# Code for normalizing the data is provided and should not be changed.
#
# At the bottom of this file, we provide  some testing
# code in case you want to check your model.

# Note: Do not use lambda layers in your model, they are not supported
# on the grading infrastructure.

## converts the MAE of your model to a score from 0 to 5 as follows:

#test_val = 100 * result
#score = math.ceil(17 - test_val)
#if score > 5:
#    score = 5

#print(score)
